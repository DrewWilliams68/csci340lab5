                        <p>     A long time ago, there was a kingdom named Chess. A quaint little place ruled by a kind<strong> King</strong> and <strong>Queen</strong>. These two ruled over
      chess for years, growing closer together everyday. On the young rulers' anniversary, the <strong>Queen</strong> gifted the <strong>King</strong> a blue wool scarf that 
      she made. The <strong>King</strong> charished this scarf so much that it never left his side. With tensions of the bordering kingdom growing stronger, 
      the <strong>King</strong> was forced to command his army and go on many tiring journeys. The only thing that got him through these rough times was this, now 
      weathered, scarf. It was constant reminder of the love he shared with his beloved <strong>Queen</strong>. Finally, after many months of this conflict, the 
      two lands made a peace treaty. Content, the <strong>King</strong> lead his tired soldiers home to their kingdom. After arriving back home, they had a 
      huge banquet to celebrate their triumphant return! With the feeling of peace restored, the <strong>King</strong>, <strong>Queen</strong>, and citizens of chess, retired back
      to their homes. But this peace would soon be short lived...

          In the late of hours of the night, chaos erupted. Awoken by the uproar, the <strong>King</strong> and <strong>Queen</strong> realized the bordering kingdom was invading.
      The peace treaty was apparenty a ruse and the bordering kingdom is now attacking the kingdom. In response to this betrayal, the <strong>King</strong> and <strong>Queen</strong>
      gathered their remaining loyal subjects which include:
      <div class="list">
      <ul>
      <li>Two Bishops</li>
      <li>Two Knights</li>
      <li>Two Rooks</li>
      <li>Eight Pawns</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
          With these forces, the chances of defeating the rival army was slim, but nevertheless they entered the battle. Under the direction of
      their <strong>King</strong>, Chess's forces managed to hold off the opposing army for a short while. Eventually, the forces of Chess were overwhelmed
      and all that remained were a few pawns and the <strong>King</strong> and <strong>Queen</strong>. The <strong>King</strong>, intent on escaping with his bride, took out an opposing Knight and
      bishop while leading the <strong>Queen</strong> to safety. The <strong>Queen</strong> however, knew that the only chance winning against the opposing <strong>King</strong>, was to 
      sacrifice herself and let one of her pawns advance. Knowing the <strong>King</strong> would never agree to this, she stopped running and managed to take
      the last remaining Rook and pawns before meeting her end to the opposing <strong>King</strong>. The <strong>King</strong>, distraught, ran to his wife's corpse. Unable to go on,
      the <strong>King</strong> was unable to capture the opposing <strong>King</strong>, so it ended in a stale mate. With his love gone, his palace burned to the ground, and 
      most of his kingdom in shambles, he had to keep moving forward and manage this catastrophe. By morning the kingdom started showing signs of recovery.
      After the flames died down, the <strong>King</strong> returned to his crumbled castle, looking for any remnant of his late <strong>Queen</strong>. In the rubble of what 
      used to be his bedroom, he found his, now singed, scarf. Unable to handle his grief, he found a semi flat pile of rubble, which he sat
      and reflected for hours. All that remained of his <strong>Queen</strong> was this scarf and the lingering regret of being fooled by his enemy.
